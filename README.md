Dynamic Maze Solver

This is a Java program for solving mazes dynamically using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The program provides an interactive graphical interface where users can set the start and end points of the maze and watch as the shortest path is dynamically computed and displayed.

Features:

Interactive GUI: Set start and end points by clicking on the maze.
Dynamic Pathfinding: Uses BFS to find the shortest path from the start to the end point.
Visual Feedback: Displays the maze with walls, start, end, and shortest path colored differently for clear visualization.
Efficient Algorithm: BFS ensures completeness and optimality in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
Customizable: Easily adjustable maze size and layout for experimentation and testing.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile and run the DynamicMazeSolver.java file.
Set the start and end points by left-clicking and right-clicking on the maze, respectively.
Press Enter to initiate pathfinding and watch as the shortest path is dynamically computed and displayed.
